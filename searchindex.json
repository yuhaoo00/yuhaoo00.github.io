[{"content":"Can we generate images in the same way as autoregressive language model?\nAlthough this sounds simpler than diffusion models, we still need to deal with many computational cost problems. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much, there are serval brilliant methods to try to make this idea more competitive.\nTaming Transformer -\u0026gt; Patrick Esser, et al. CVPR 2021\nThe key challenge of autoregressive generation is how to solve the quadratically increasing cost of image sequences that are much longer than texts. For this sake, the Taming Transformer is designed as a two-stage approach including a VQGAN and an Autoregressive Transformer.\n1.1 VQ-GAN Summary of taming transformer Vector quantization is a brilliant idea to provide the compression and discrete representation for images (like a image tokenizer). Inspired by that, VQ-GAN realizes more effective representation with patchGAN, compressing an image into a learnable space (codebook). More precisely, any image $x\\in R^{H\\times W\\times 3}$ can be represented by a discrete vector $s \\in R^{h×w}$ (an index set of the closest codebook entries).\nThe training objective for finding the optimal compression model can be expressed as:\n$$ \\begin{align} \u0026amp;L_{VQ}=L_{perceptual}+||sg(E(x))-z_q||^2_2+\\beta||sg(z_q)-E(x)||^2_2 \\\\ \u0026amp;L_{GAN}=\\log{D(x)}+\\log{(1-D(\\hat{x}))} \\\\ \u0026amp;\\arg{\\min_{E,G,Z}\\max_{D}}\\ \\mathbb{E}\\lbrack L_{VQ}(E,G,Z)+\\lambda L_{GAN}(E,G,Z,D)\\rbrack \\end{align} $$\nwhere the adaptive weight $\\lambda=\\nabla_{G_L}[L_{rec}]/(\\nabla_{G_L}[L_{GAN}]+10^{−6})$ tends to focus on the smaller one of $L_{rec}$ and $L_{GAN}$.\n1.2 Autoregression For the autoregressive transformer, it can be implemented by the \u0026ldquo;decoder-only\u0026rdquo; structure and the casual self-attention mask. And we can directly maximize the log-likelihood of the data representations as:\n$$ L_{Transformer} = \\mathbb{E}[-\\log(\\Pi_i{p(s_i|s_{\u0026lt;i})})] $$\nSliding attention window When generating images in the megapixel regime (\u0026gt;256^2), that transformer will adopt the local attention in a sliding-window manner for efficiency. Since transformer is a kind of network without inductive bias, we need the spatial conditioning information or the training dataset with spatial invariance to ensure such local strategy work well.\nParti -\u0026gt; Jiahui Yu, et al. arXiv 2022\nParti (Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image) shows that above two-stage autoregressive method is able to realize high-fidelity generation for text-to-image with additional fine-tuning and upsampling.\n2.1 ViT-VQGAN They first train a stronger ViT-VQGAN-Small encoder (30M) as a image tokenizer on their training data, which achieves 4x downsampling (i.e., $256\\to 32$) and learns 8192 image token classes for the codebook.\n2.2 Text-to-Image Summary of Parti The text-to-image model is based on a classical encoder-decoder architecture in multi-modal tasks. They build a SentencePiece model as the text encoder which provides text tokens of length 128. This text encoder is first pretrain on two datasets: the C4 datasets with BERT loss, and their image-text datasets with contrastive loss.\nAfter pretraining, they continue training both encoder and decoder for text-to-image generation with softmax cross-entropy loss. Nothing that the decoder uses conv-shaped masked sparse attention (like the sliding window in Taming Transformer).\nThe ability of text encoder after pretraining performs comparably to BERT, but degrades after the full encoder-decoder training, which indicates the difference between language representation and image-grounded language representation.\nClassifier-free guidance has been adopted to great effect for Parti. During inference, tokens are sampled from a linear combination of logits sampled from an unconditional model and a conditional model on a text prompt.\n2.3 Fine-tune \u0026amp; Super-Resolution After two-stage training, they freeze the image tokenizer and codebook, and fine-tune a larger-size image detokenizer (600M) to further improve visual acuity.\nA learned super-resolution module to upsample images Moreover, they employ a simple super-resolution network (15M~30M) on top of the image detokenizer. This SR-network is based on WDSR and trained with the same losses of ViT-VQGAN (perceptual loss, StyleGAN loss and l2 loss). It has about 15M parameters for 2x upsampling and 30M parameters for 4x upsampling.\nMuse -\u0026gt; Huiwen Chang, et al. arXiv 2023\nAlthough above solutions alleviate high training cost to some extent, the autoregressive paradigm still slows down inference significantly. Can we adopt parallel iteration instead of one by one? Muse give that answer which employs a random masking strategy (like MLM in NLP) to facilitate predicting multiple tokens at once.\n3.1 Frozen LLM as Text Encoder Recent works show that the conceptual representations learned by LLMs are roughly linearly mappable to those learned by models trained on vision tasks. Fueled by these observations, Muse adopts frozen T5-XXL as the text encoder and tries to map those rich visual and semantic concepts in the LLM embeddings to the generated images. These embedding vectors are linearly projected to the hidden size of later Transformer models (base and super-res).\n3.2 Base Model The base model of Muse Muse\u0026rsquo;s base model has the same encoder-decoder architecture as Parti, but it employs a random masking strategy to ensure learning more expressive and robust.\nThey leave all the text embeddings unmasked and randomly mask a varying fraction of image tokens and replace them with a special [MASK] token. The masking rate is a variable based on a cosine scheduling $r\\sim p(r)=\\frac{2}{\\pi} (1 − r^2)^{-1/2}$, where the bias towards higher masking rates makes the prediction problem harder.\nNoting that this masking functions on input rather than attention layers.\nIn this way, the base model is trained to predict all masked tokens at once.\n3.3 Super-Resolution Model The super-resolution model of Muse For the high-resolution generation, the authors found that directly predicting $512\\times 512$ resolution leads the model to focus on low-level details over large-scale semantics. To this end, they trained another decoder to predict masked tokens in higher resolution with the help of low-res conditioning and text conditioning.\n3.4 Fine-tune Following the Parti model, Muse increases the capacity of the VQGAN decoder by the addition of more residual layers and channels, and then fine-tune the new decoder layers while other modules frozen.\n3.5 Iterative Parallel Decoding Inference samples in Muse The above masked learning support us to decode multiple tokens at each step, so this inference is called as iterative parallel decoding. Based on a cosine schedule, we predict all masked tokens at each step, and choose a fraction of the highest confidence tokens as unmasked, and continue next step to predict remaining masked tokens.\nPer-batch inference time for several models. Using this procedure, Muse is able to perform high-fidelity inference using only 24 steps in base model and 8 steps in super-resolution model, and is significantly faster than competing diffusion or other autoregressive models.\n","date":"26 September, 2023","id":0,"permalink":"/posts/snapshots/2309arforvisiongeneration/","summary":"Can we generate images in the same way as autoregressive language model?\nAlthough this sounds simpler than diffusion models, we still need to deal with many computational cost problems.

CLIP is representative of this type of work. Although its motivation is to learn a transferable visual model (like BERT) for downstream vision tasks, CLIP has brought a lot of inspirations for multi-modal tasks. Therefore, I prefer to describe CLIP and variants as how to learn a better multi-modal feature space.\nCLIP -\u0026gt; Alec Radford, et al. NeuraIPS 2021\nThe model architecture of CLIP (source from paper) CLIP has a quite simple design which consists of a joint-training image encoder and text encoder, but there are still some interesting details worth noting.\n1.1 Bag-of-words encoding In the text encoder, the output at last [EOS] token are used as the feature representation of the text (i.e. $[N,L]\\to[N,L,D]\\to[N,D]$). The authors refer to this process as \u0026ldquo;Bag-of-words Encoding\u0026rdquo; where the text of arbitrary length can be encoded into a D-dimensional vector.\nIn Stable Diffusion, CLIP\u0026rsquo;s text encoder is used to provide crucial text feature. People often take full-sequence features (skip last 1 or 2 layers) from CLIP\u0026rsquo;s text encoder into the cross-attention to realize a \u0026ldquo;word-by-word instruction\u0026rdquo;. But indeed, if you take only the feature at last [EOS] token as the instruction, the results will be fine due to its globality.\n1.2 Contrastive learning The contrastive learning is implemented by optimizing a symmetric cross entropy loss over the cosine similarity score. We say that an image-text pair is matched if the cosine similarity between their embeddings is high enough.\nIn this paper, they set a learnable temperature parameter $e^t$ to scale the similarities, but didn\u0026rsquo;t explain much. I speculate such exponentiation can make learning more sensitive (imagine that steep curve) than a pure scalar.\nBTW, the authors separate out l2_normalize() and refer to np.dot() as the cosine similarity, which is of course equivalent but might be confusing.\nBLIP -\u0026gt; Junnan Li, et al. ICML 2022 The model architecture of BLIP (source from paper) In addition to the contrastive learning, BLIP introduces two more vision-language objectives: image-text matching and image-conditioned language modeling. Such multimodal mixture of encoder-decoder model is jointly trained with three objectives, enabling a wider range of downstream tasks.\n2.1 Coarse-grained alignment Similar to CLIP, BLIP includes the image-text contrastive learning by two unimodal encoders. We can think of such alignment is coarse-grained, since the interaction between the features from two modalities occurs only in the last shallow linear network.\nA few differences from CLIP are listed below:\nThe global feature of the whole text is allocated at the first [CLS] token instead of the [EOS]. BLIP\u0026rsquo;s text encoder and image encoder is initialized from BERT-base and ViT (pre-trained on ImageNet), instead of training from scratch. (CLIP\u0026rsquo;s networks are heavily modified and scaled, so there are certainly no suitable pre-trained baselines for initialization.) 2.2 Fine-grained alignment The image-grounded (conditioned) text encoder aims to learn image-text multimodal representation with dense cross-attention layer, which can capture the fine-grained alignment. The objective is a binary classification task to predict whether an image-text pair is matched or not.\nNoting that here they adopt the hard negative mining strategy, where those negatives pairs with higher contrastive similarity in a batch will be more likely to be chosen to compute the 0-1 loss. It makes sense because some unmatched pairs may have quite high cosine scores. Such filtering strategy is obviously another sense of fine-grained.\n2.3 Language modeling Altering to the masked self-attention can preserve the ability of language modeling with a new auxiliary objective, and is the future work as mentioned in CLIP. Now BLIP realizes this thing with the image-grounded text decoder.\nThis decoder is inherited from the image-grounded text encoder, where bi-directional SAs are replaced with causal SAs (i.e. triangle) just like in the regular text decoder. Correspondingly, it optimizes a cross entropy loss which trains the model to maximize the likelihood of the text in an autoregressive manner. And the text decoder share all parameters with text encoder except for the SA layers, since the remaining layers serve a similar function.\nPreserving the ability of LM enforce the image feature to capture all the information about the text, therefore make it easy to transfer to those vision-language generation tasks, such as Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering, and etc. But this LM objective also makes the learned feature more \u0026ldquo;text-like\u0026rdquo;, whether from the text encoder, text decoder, or even image encoder.\n2.4 Dataset bootstrapping They introduce a captioner to produce synthetic captions for web images, and a filter to remove noisy image-text pairs. (source from paper) BLIP-2 -\u0026gt; Junnan Li, et al. arXiv 2023 The model architecture of BLIP-2 (source from paper) BLIP-2 consists of (1) an image transformer that interacts with the frozen image encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) a text transformer that can function as both a text encoder and a text decoder. These two transformers share the same SA layers.\n3.1 Learnable queries A set number of learnable queries is created as input to the image transformer. Instead of taking image patches as input, allocating learnable queries can output the smaller-length $L=32$ features independent of image resolution (since the encoder/decoder-only model outputs the same length sequence as input). The output embeddings from these queries will be forced to extract visual features that capture all the information about the text, by three objectives. Due to such query\u0026rsquo;s importance, BLIP-2\u0026rsquo;s network is also known as the Q-Former.\n3.2 Shared self-attention We have observed that BLIP-1\u0026rsquo;s sub-networks have many common points in architectures and even in weights. So why not merge them as possible? and how?\nThe brilliance of BLIP-2 is that they employ different SA masking strategies for different objective to restrict the interaction between the vision token and text token, so two branches in the Q-Former can share the same SA layers. The self-attention masking strategy (source from paper) Although the masking strategies and the joint-training for three objectives sounds very straightforward and reasonable, there are a lot of unclear details waiting to be revealed in the source code.\nFor the contrastive learning, the query and text will be passed into Q-Former, respectively. Noting that the key\u0026amp;value of SA layers in the image transformer will be cached for later use.\nquery_output = self.Qformer.bert( query_embeds=query_tokens, encoder_hidden_states=image_embeds, encoder_attention_mask=image_atts, use_cache=True, return_dict=True, ) text_output = self.Qformer.bert( text_tokens.input_ids, attention_mask=text_tokens.attention_mask, return_dict=True, ) For the image-text matching, the query will be concatenated with the text and passed into Q-Former. All queries and texts can attend to each other.\noutput_itm = self.Qformer.bert( text_ids_all, query_embeds=query_tokens_itm, attention_mask=attention_mask_all, encoder_hidden_states=image_embeds_all, encoder_attention_mask=image_atts_all, return_dict=True, ) For the language modeling, there are only the text (first token is replaced by [DEC]) as input to the Q-Former. As the visual instruction, the previous key\u0026amp;value caches (with pure visual information) will be concatenated with the current key\u0026amp;value (from the texts), and then passed to the SA layers with a multimodal causal mask.\nlm_output = self.Qformer( decoder_input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, past_key_values=query_output.past_key_values, return_dict=True, labels=labels, ) Compared to BLIP-1, the shared SAs of BLIP2 make the output query embeddings more \u0026ldquo;text-like\u0026rdquo; inevitably, so the image encoder should be frozen to counteract such imbalance.\n3.3 Bootstrap LLM Benefit from the LM objective, the output query embedding contains rich image and text features. So them can function as soft visual prompts to LLM by a simple linear projection.\n(Top) Bootstrapping a decoder-based LLM.

On the one hand, people hope that the generated images can follow some predefined physical attributes, such as the number, position, size, and texture of objects. On the other hand, they also require the T2I models to retain a certain level of creativity.\nAt present, there are quite a lot of researches related to controllable T2I generation. I prefer to divide them into two categories: one primarily focuses on correcting the generation path in inference, called Explicit Control; the other one strengthens the network through fine-tuning or adding new layers, called Implicit Control.\nThis blog, as the first part of this series, will summarize representative researches related to Explicit Control, which can be further divided into two technical routes: forward guidance and backward guidance. The discussion of implicit control will be updated in another blog post.\nPS: This explicit or implicit statement comes from my personal preference and is not yet widely accepted in the academic community.\nEarly Explorations before the Stable Diffusion Image-to-Image \u0026amp; Inpainting -\u0026gt; Chenlin Meng, et al. arXiv 2021\n-\u0026gt; Andreas Lugmayr, et al. CVPR 2022\nThe idea of explicit control can date back to before the Stable Diffusion, with two classic examples being SDEdit (Image-to-Image) and RePaint (Inpainting). Due to their relatively simple principles, here we just briefly summarize them:\nSDEdit uses a noisy version of a reference image as the starting point for the denoising process, ensuring that the generated image maintains a similar color layout to the reference image. Repaint, during the denoising process, combines the masked background image with the predicted foreground image to realize inpainting new content in the masked regions.\nBoth of these classic methods achieve controllable generation through modify denoising process (without any training), demonstrating the strong robustness of the diffusion model and the significant potential for modifying the denoising process manually!\nIn the Diffusers library, the StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline has two versions. The unfinetuned version is based on the idea of Repaint without training, while the finetuned version involves concatenating the Mask and Masked_image_latents as additional 5 channels to the input of Unet and fine-tuning all layers. The latter version achieves better results.\nBlended Diffusion -\u0026gt; Omri Avrahami, et al. CVPR 2022\nA simple diagram of the Blended Diffusion With the introduction of CLIP technology, Blended Diffusion achieves text-driven inpainting. The basic approach can be summarized as above figure. In each iteration, $\\hat{x_0}$ is predicted based on the inverse equation of the known $p(x_t|x_0)$, and is masked accordingly. Then, the masked image and the text prompt are jointly input into CLIP to obtain a cosine similarity score $\\mathcal{L}$ (with the trick of data augmentation to improve sensitivity). The gradient of this score is used to update the latent $\\epsilon(x_t)+\\nabla_{\\hat{x_0}}\\mathcal{L}$. Moreover, the foreground and background images are fused based on the given mask to update the latent $x_{t-1}$ for next iteration.\nThis approach is essentially a combination of CLIP-based T2I and Repaint method. In fact, the CLIP-based generation is a kind of classifier-based guidance, where the iteration values are updated based on the gradient of a certain criterion. Although this gradient-based approach may sound a little old-school in the days of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), we can still see its effectiveness in serval cutting-edge studies later on.\nForward Guidance Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross Attention -\u0026gt; Amir Hertz, et al. arXiv 2022\nPrompt-to-Prompt (P2P) focuses on editing already generated images, which may not be relevant to controllable generation, but it shows great potential of manipulating Cross Attention (CA) maps and brings quite a lot of inspiration to controllable generation techniques!\nCross-Attention visualization in Unet (from the paper) As shown above, P2P first found that CA corresponding to text tokens had strong semantic information (even in the early stages of generation). This finding seems obvious when you realize that CA is the similarity between image features and text features. But no one had visualized them before, and such strong semantic connections were not well known!\nAt the same time, this observation also reveals how the CA mechanism drives T2I generation. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine the data flow: the sequence of text features from CLIP is first mapped to base values, then fused at different locations based on attention weights (the similarity between images and texts), and finally makes up the image we see (magical multimodal learning)!\nImage editing effect achieved by P2P (from the paper) More excitingly, the authors successfully controlled generation by manipulating CA values:\nReplacing the CA corresponding to a text token for content replacement. Deleting the CA corresponding to a text token for content erasure. Adding the CA corresponding to a text token for content addition. Weighting the CA corresponding to a text token to effectively enhance or weaken content. Now we can enhance or weaken the content by weighting the text features from CLIP directly. This \u0026ldquo;weighted prompt\u0026rdquo; trick is widely integrated into various T2I tools (such as compel, A1111-webui, Midjourney, etc.).\nCompositional Visual Generation with Composable Diffusion Models -\u0026gt; Nan Liu, et al. ECCV 2022\nA simple diagram of the Composed Diffusion Composed Diffusion supports the generation of more content or objects. Although this paper is inspired by composing multiple EBMs, this idea is equivalent to the advanced CFG formally. In short, multiple text prompts separated by the \u0026ldquo;AND\u0026rdquo; symbol are fed into the diffusion model separately and then weighted to produce the results:\n$$ \\hat{\\epsilon}(x_t,t)=\\epsilon(x_t,t)+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i(\\epsilon(x_t,t|c_i)-\\epsilon(x_t,t)) $$\nThis synthesis is a bit crude and often less than expected, because different content will merge globally without explicit location constraints. Therefore, Composed Diffusion is more suitable for those multi-content with large spatial differences to avoid unexpected conflicts.\nComposing effect achieved by Composed Diffusion (from the paper) MultiDiffusion: Fusing Diffusion Paths for Controlled Image Generation -\u0026gt; Omer Bar-Tal, et al. arXiv 2023\nA simple diagram of the MultiDiffusion If we want more control over spatial position, the most direct way is to draw something in a certain region by specifying a target mask or box. While this sounds like a multi-region inpainting task, the question is how to ensure that they are independent and harmonious with each other?\nMultiDiffusion gives the answer. The authors first build a mathematical optimization model for harmonious multi-region generation and derive a closed-form solution:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\Psi\\left(J_t \\mid z\\right)=\\arg\\min_{J\\in\\mathcal{J}}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left|W_i \\otimes\\left[F_i(J)-\\Phi\\left(I_t^i \\mid y_i\\right)\\right]\\right|^2 \\\\ \\Psi\\left(J_t \\mid z\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{F_i^{-1}\\left(W_i\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n F_j^{-1}\\left(W_j\\right)} \\otimes F_i^{-1}\\left(\\Phi\\left(I_t^i \\mid y_i\\right)\\right) \\end{align} $$\nIn fact, MultiDiffusion can be understood as a multi-region extension of Repaint. It fuses multiple images generated from different regions (depending on the degree of overlap) in each step, and then eliminates dissonance at the boundaries solely by the robustness of the denoising process. Obviously, due to the lack of interaction between the central features of different regions, the final generated image has obvious style variations across regions.\nThe derived fusion equation is intuitive and can be obtained even without establishing the optimization problem. But it does make the whole paper more academic\u0026hellip; -_-\nTraining-Free Structured Diffusion Guidance for Compositional Text-to-Image Synthesis -\u0026gt; Weixi Feng, et al. ICLR 2023 A simple diagram of the Structured Diffusion Similar to the goal of Composed Diffusion, Structured Diffusion seeks to synthesize more content through text input alone. The approach derives from two key observations: first, the Cross-Attention of the input text token is very semantic (also observed by P2P); Second, CLIP\u0026rsquo;s text encoder (based on Transformer) will inevitably incorporate contextual information for each token.\nTherefore, Structured Diffusion attempts to ensure that specific text is not affected by context so that the corresponding content is properly synthesized. They first strip all the noun phrases from a sentence using a parser like Constituency Tree or Scene Graph; Then input these noun phrases into the CLIP text encoder separately to avoid mutual influence; And fill in the rest with the features of the whole sentence $W_p$; Finally, in the Unet, these new text features $W_i$ will be mapped into new values $V_i$, and fused according to the old CA $M^t$:\n$$ O^t=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(M^tV_i) $$\nNote that attention is still computed from the original whole-sentence query, which contribute to the spatial layout allocation.\nThus, we enhance the features of all noun phrases and reduce their interference with each other. Unfortunately, the actual improvement from this approach is not obvious.\nBackward Guidance Training-Free Layout Control with Cross-Attention Guidance -\u0026gt; Minghao Chen, et al. arXiv 2023\nThis paper attempts to implement control generation for multiple regions with a single diffusion model, called layout control. Interestingly, the authors explore two different methods of guidance: 1. a region constraint imposed in the generation iteration, also known as forward guidance; 2. a gradient-based update idea similar to Blended Diffusion, also known as backward guidance.\nA simple diagram of the Layout Control In particular, the forward guidance will modify the Cross-Attention of the specified text tokens (in each layer) to cluster them into the specified box:\n$$ \\hat{A_{p,i}}=(1-\\lambda)A_{p,i}+\\lambda g_p\\sum_{j}A_{j,i} $$\nWhere $p$ is the position coordinate, $i$ is the index of the text token, $g_p$ is the gaussian weight in a specified box (sum of 1), and $\\sum_{j}A_{j,i}$ is the sum of the entire CA Map. It means that the latter term in the equation will redistribute the attention weights according to the gaussian box.\nBackward guidance defines a function to measure the CA concentration of a given token over a given box $B$:\n$$ E(A,B,i)=\\left(1-\\frac{\\sum_{p\\in B}A_{p,i}}{\\sum_{p}A_{p,i}}\\right)^2 $$\nWe update the latent $x_t$ at the current time step with the gradient of this metric as shown in the figure.\nAccording to the experimental results, the backward guidance is more effective (and of course consumes more running time). In addition, the author also integrates this method with Dreambooth and Text Inversion, which still achieve a good control effect.\nAttend-and-Excite: Attention-Based Semantic Guidance for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models -\u0026gt; Hila Chefer et al. ACM Trans. Graph. 2023\nSimilar to the observations in P2P, this paper assumes that if something is not generated as expected, the corresponding Cross-Attention should be increased. The difference, however, is that Attend-and-Excite establishes a certain metric as a loss function and backpropagates the gradient to excite the update of latents, rather than forcing up the corresponding value by direct re-weighting.\nAttend-and-Excite Specifically, we first need to select a few text tokens as the target to be enhanced (for example, the 2nd and 5th), calculate their corresponding average cross-attention ($A_t^2,A_t^5$), and then take the smallest peak of them as the loss:\n$$ Loss=max\\left(1-max(A_t^2),1-max(A_t^5)\\right) $$\nFinally, the latent is updated according to the gradient as $x_t^{\\prime}=x_t-\\alpha \\nabla_{x_t} Loss$, which encourages the peak cross-attention of all selected text tokens to be as high as possible. Of course, there are several limitations of Attend-and-Excite as follows:\nManually selecting the index of the enhanced token is not a convenient and perfect solution. If and only the excitation in the middle scale of Unet is effective. Because not all scales of cross-attention have semantic information and contribute semantically to the final generation. This involves too many hyperparameter settings, such as artificial thresholds that determine the number of backward updates during early iterations. DragDiffusion: Harnessing Diffusion Models for Interactive Point-based Image Editing -\u0026gt; Yujun Shi, et al. arXiv 2023\nDragDiffusion is a direct extension of the famous DragGAN. Similarly, DragDiffusion can achieve image editing by dragging multiple points, and the principle behind it is the backward guidance for the generated path by gradient-based update.\nAttend-and-Excite As shown above, in addition to the regular diffusion denoising, the generated path in DragDiffusion contains two other mappings: Motion Supervision and Point Tracking. The loss function of Motion Supervision is shown as follows:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(z_t^k\\right)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{q \\in \\Omega\\left(h_i^k, r_1\\right)}\\lVert F_{q+d_i}\\left(z_t^k\\right)-\\operatorname{sg}\\left(F_q\\left(z_t^k\\right)\\right) \\rVert_1 +\\lambda \\lVert \\left(z_{t-1}^k-\\operatorname{sg}\\left(z_{t-1}^0\\right)\\right) \\odot(1-M) \\rVert_1 $$\nIn simple terms, the former of this loss encourages feature movement at the patch level $F_{\\Omega+d_i}(z_t^k) \\gets F_{\\Omega}(z_t^k)$, while the latter keeps the pixel values outside the mask nearly constant $(1-M)z_t^k \\approx (1-M)z_t^{k+1}$.\nHere $sg(\\cdot)$ is the stop gradient operator, which makes the pixel values $F_{\\Omega}(z_t^k)$ in the original patch are not affected by gradient descent directly. We can calculate the gradient and update the latent as follows:\n$$ z_t^{k+1}=z_t^k-\\eta \\cdot \\nabla_{z_t^k} \\mathcal{L} $$\nPoint Tracking is used to rematch the location of the handle points, which is implemented directly using a nearest neighbor search:\n$$ h_i^{k+1}=\\underset{q \\in \\Omega\\left(h_i^k, r_2\\right)}{\\arg \\min }\\left|F_q\\left(z_t^{k+1}\\right)-F_{h_i^k}\\left(z_t\\right)\\right|_1 $$\nAlthough this method directly follows DragGAN\u0026rsquo;s idea, the non-stationary iterative process of the Diffusion Models makes many hyperparameter different, and the author also abandons CFG to avoid large numerical errors.\n","date":"17 August, 2023","id":2,"permalink":"/posts/snapshots/2308controlgenerationa/","summary":"Controllable Text-To-Image (T2I) generation has always been a major challenge in diffusion models.

I prefer to divide them into two categories: one primarily focuses on correcting the generation path in inference, called Explicit Control; the other one strengthens the network through fine-tuning or adding new layers, called Implicit Control.","tags":"ImageGeneration Diffusion ControlledGeneration Text2Image","title":"Controllable Text-To-Image Diffusion Models —— Explicit Control"},{"content":"Guided Generation Hybrid-condition by Fine-Tuning ","date":"20 July, 2023","id":3,"permalink":"/posts/analysis/2307inpaintpipeline/","summary":"Guided Generation Hybrid-condition by Fine-Tuning ","tags":"Diffusion ImageGeneration Text2Image Inpainting","title":"Two Inpainting Pipelines in Diffusers"},{"content":"StabilityAI has recently open sourced a series of foundational models for image generation, called Stable Diffusion.

Notice that this last generative process is set to noiseless to ensure the lossless codelength of discrete data.\nAt the end, we can realize the efficient training by optimizing random terms of $L_t$ with stochastic gradient descent (Alg. 1).

As $\\beta \\approx \\tilde{\\beta}$ In the early process, the perceptual details generated from these two is very similar. So the other constants might not matter at all for sample quality due to decreasing nature $\\frac{\\beta_t}{\\beta_{t-1}} \\to 0$.\nFinding 2: The diffusion samples from linear schedule lose information very quickly. In the diffusion process, these samples will soon become the noise without any information. Even if the early generation is skipped (~20%), the quality does not get much worse. It suggests that so much full noisy samples might do not contribute to generation.\nImprovements Learnable variances with an interpolation between $\\beta$ and $\\tilde{\\beta}$, driven by loss $+ \\lambda L_{vlb}$. Cosine schedule has a linear drop off in the middle of the process, while changing very little near the start and the end.

(Indeed, the authors emphasize that empirically sliced score matching can train NCSNs as well as denoising score matching.)\nOne More Thing In the score matching, the authors approximately have $\\left| s_{\\theta}( x, \\sigma)\\right|_2 \\propto 1 / \\sigma$, so they choose $\\lambda (\\sigma) = \\sigma^2$ to make the order magnitude of loss under various noise levels roughly the same, and independent of $\\sigma$.\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta ;\\lbrace\\sigma_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^{L}\\right) \\triangleq \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^L \\lambda\\left(\\sigma_i\\right) \\ell\\left(\\theta ; \\sigma_i\\right) $$\nCorrespondingly, in the langevin dynamics, they choose $\\alpha_i \\propto \\sigma^2$ to make the order magnitude of \u0026ldquo;signal-to-noise ratio\u0026rdquo; independent of $\\sigma$.\nReferences Yang Song and Stefano Ermon, ‘Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution’, in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019.
